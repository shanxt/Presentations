# Things to do when stuck at home #
Since everyone is now going to be at home for an extended period of time, there's a good chance you may get bored quickly.
Luckily, we have access to the greatest resource of information and knowledge known to humanity - the Internet.

These are just a list of things we can do for the next few weeks to keep ourselves occupied, as well as to give ourselves a break from work - office and house work.

## Exercise ##
Exercise is critical for physical as well as mental well-being. Decide on any regime, but do continue with it.
Two suggestions here:

### Yoga ###
30 Days of Yoga at home With Adriene - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWBfQjuwp4E&list=PLui6Eyny-UzzFFfpiil94CUrWKVMaqmkm
A few videos for children:
* Yoga For Beginners | Ages 3-5 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBko9JPMtHs
* Yoga with Adriene for kids - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMMRb10LtGM 
* Alo yoga - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZpkRAcgws4

### Body weight exercises ###
Lots of videos online, but you could start off with Antranik - https://antranik.org/rr/
Some of them may require equipment, but if you don't have those, just skip those particular exercises.



## Education ##

### For children (and adults): ###
Probably one of the best free resources out there - https://www.khanacademy.org/
They've got courses across all classes covering various syllabuses, so any school-going child can continue their studies here.

### Other online courses: ###
* Udemy, Coursera, edX, etc for technical courses, as well as anything else that may interest you - politics, arts, economics, etc
* Harvard also has free online courses, with everything from Religious studies to Beethoven's music - https://online-learning.harvard.edu/catalog/free 



## Miscelleneous ## 

### Cooking ###
Tons of videos on youtube are available for any kind of cooking. I'm personally following Tarla Dalal's recipes right now.

### Reading ###
* Finish any books you may have lying around at home
* If you don't have paper books, then Ebooks or Audiobooks are a good alternative. Most common are of course Google play books and Kindle/Audible, etc.
Currently audible is also giving out free stories for children.
* Amazon Prime also includes a 3-month free audible account in India.

### Origami ###
A good fun activity to do yourself, and with the kids

### Puzzles like Crosswords, Sudoku, etc ###
Crosswords:

Sudoku:
Lots of online sites for this - sudoku.com is a good starting point.
For kids, you could print one out here - http://www.kidsmathgamesonline.com/sudoku/printableworksheets.html 
If you don't have a printer, it's pretty easy to quickly make one manually.

### Meditation ###
Good practice to get into, and relatively less time consuming - 5 to 10 minutes a day is more than enough.
To get started:

### Learn to solve the Rubik's cube! ###
Got a cube lying around at home? You now have enough free time to master it, and show off after a few weeks!
Like most things, this isn't about intelligence - there's a method to it, and practice and hardwork will get you there.
